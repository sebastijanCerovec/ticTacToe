# ticTacToe
A simple C++ project - Tic Tac Toe
## Description
My second upload to GitHub is a simple C++ project - the game of Tic Tac Toe. This was an assignment on Machina Game Dev Academys C++ programming course by lecturer Bojan BiliÄ‡. Two players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. I've uploaded a ticTacToe.exe file (Windows-based) if you want to try it out.
## Getting Started
### Setting up
* The entirety of the code is in the main.cpp file. Just start a new empty C++ project in your IDE (I've used Visual Studio 2022, so VS is preferable because in other IDEs you might get minor differences) and copy the main.cpp file to source files.
* I've added comments where I thought they would be useful.
